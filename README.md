## About the movement

We are Yanik, Henrik and Nils and our mission is to offer people the opportunity to feel a little bit less alone during the festive season by doing something good. Sounds crazy, huh? But that's exactly what we want to create with Let's Have A Toast.

### Why we do this

Due to covid19, our current time is marked with social abstinence. This is bad. And so many other important issues get lost in the media as a result. Think about Climate Change, Human Rights, Our Animals on Earth etc.. But initiatives like Fridays for future, Amnesty International etc. are not gone. They're still fighting the world's biggest problems, just like the heroes in the hospitals, making sure we're all safe. With #letshaveatoast, we want to honor them and share this with everyone around the world to unite the community and show that you are not alone. We are all here to toast together. We call it "Let's have toast" because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about: toasting to good things together - the only difference being that we're doing it virtually at scale.

### How we do this

Let’s have a toast is a web app where people from all over the world can virtually "toast" each other during festive season.The toasts are broadcasted to all users who are currently using the Webapp - that's where the sense of community is created. With each "toast" we trigger a donation for a specific topic. You can navigate through pushing the red button. First, you choose your name. Second, you select your donation category. Third, you choose your donation amount. Fourth, you pay (paypal or credit card). Fifth, you broadcast and share your toast with the world. Let’s have a toast is supposed to go live on December 24, 2020 and stay live until January 2, 2021. It would help us enormously if you could share let's have a toast with your friends.
